 # Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain
 quasarmod_megastage_dialogue.1.name: "Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain Construction"
 quasarmod_megastage_dialogue.1.desc: "We are now ready to begin the colossal task of constructing a Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain. The first step will be the construction of the hawking capacitors around the black hole, which will increase the rate at which hawking radiation is emitted. As each layer is added, more and more research will be generated. Keep in mind that the efficiency of the Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain will skyrocket once we finish the last layer. The planetary bodies of the system will be dismantled in order to make room for the terastructure."
 quasarmod_megastage_dialogue.1.a: "Wonderful."

Even systems beyond those adjacent to [event_target:qsc_destroyed_here.GetName] have been impacted, such a disaster caused by one of our own ships is surely going to hurt our diplomatic standing with those effected by the damage.\n\nAll we can do now is hope that our remaining forces will be enough to fend off the coming threat."

 qsc_self_destruct.1.desc: "You have selected the $qsc_self_destruct.1$ feature. This will have the Quasarcraft disable all systems that are actively compressing the $pc_core_quasar$, allowing it to rapidly expand.\n\nThis will result in the immediate destruction of the ship and system it resides in, the complete erasure of adjacent systems and heavy damage to systems 2-3 jumps away from the point of detonation.\n\nThe subspace backlash of the detonation will also cause significant damage to nearby hyperlanes, resulting in them being rearranged or destroyed."

If such devastation is not your intention, the next entry is for you.\n\nOn §PLow-Power§! mode, the §MEndsinger§! will put far less power into it's destructive wrath, shattering planets instead of utterly obliterating them.

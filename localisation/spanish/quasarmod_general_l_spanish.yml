 ap_hyperquasaric_megaconstruction: "Hyperquasaric Megaconstruction"
 ap_hyperquasaric_megaconstruction_desc: "The size and scale of our ambitions are rapidly outgrowing our ability to achieve them, we must reach a level of resource exploitation larger than has ever been seen in the history of our galaxy if we wish to ensure our unending prosperity."

 # Teraforge

 tech_hyperquasaric_teraforge: "Hyperquasaric Megafoundries"
 tech_hyperquasaric_teraforge_desc: "Our ambitions are rapidly outgrowing our ability to produce the resources necessary to realize them, the cataclysmic power of an active hyperquasar may be able to help us with that."
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_TERAFORGE_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Hyperquasaric Teraforge"
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_TERAFORGE_DESC: "A truly gargantuan alloy processing facility residing in the galactic core,\nreaching approximately 100 AU in diameter and harnessing the power of an active Hyperquasar, the Hyperquasaric Teraforge is the largest source of alloys in our corner of the universe."

 # Megashipyard

 tech_hyperquasaric_megashipyard: "Hyperquasaric Shipbuilding Facilities"
 tech_hyperquasaric_megashipyard_desc: "The raw power of the $hyperstructural_ass_4$ was once enough to sustain entire empires, yet these once impressive structures are struggling to keep up with the demands of a modern galactic navy, we must dream bigger."
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_MEGASHIPYARD_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Hyperquasaric Megashipyard"
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_MEGASHIPYARD_DESC: "Employing similar technology to the $hyperstructural_ass_4$, the $hyperquasaric_megashipyard_4$ is the natural progression of a galaxy spanning navy in the making."

 # SMBH Manipulator

 tech_smbh_manipulator: "Supermassive Black Hole Manipulation"
 tech_smbh_manipulator_desc: "Taking inspiration from our previous endeavours into Stellar Manipulation, our most talented engineers and physicists have devised plans for a similar celestial manipulation project on a scale several orders of magnitude larger than any before it; we shall transform the very heart of the galaxy to suit our needs."
 TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulator"
 #TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Feature:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulation \n§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulator"
 TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_DESC: "The supermassive black hole residing within the galactic core no longer suits our needs, we shall reshape it to better serve our empire."

 # Core MBrain

 tech_core_mbrain: "Hyperscale Black Hole Computation"
 tech_core_mbrain_desc: "Despite the fact that we have constructed the largest computational devices in history, our simulations and experiments are growing ever more complex and even the largest computers our galaxy has ever seen are struggling to keep up. We must go bigger."
 TECH_UNLOCK_GARGANTUAN_MBRAIN_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain"
 TECH_UNLOCK_GARGANTUAN_MBRAIN_DESC: "The most powerful computer to ever exist within the history of our galaxy, capable of mapping and accurately simulating hundreds of billions of star systems at once, we can effectively simulate an entire small universe with relative ease.\nThe existential and philosophical implications of such a fact will rock our society for generations to come."

 # Quasarcraft

 tech_quasarcraft_1: "An Armament of Galactic Proportions"
 tech_quasarcraft_1_desc: "With the advent of mightier foes, even our most powerful ships are no longer strong enough. Our finest minds have thus began dreaming, we shall create a weapon to pierce the heavens. So begins the Quasarcraft Project."

 tech_quasarcraft_2: "Pentadimensional Engineering"
 tech_quasarcraft_2_desc: "The discovery and application of tetradimensional engineering techniques has enabled us to construct wonders spanning billions of kilometers, yet, the megastructures of tomorrow demand even greater innovation. In order to circumvent the limits of modern construction techniques, we must set our sights higher: Pentadimensional Engineering. By shifting entire structures five-dimensional space, we can drastically reduce their footprint in the third dimension, allowing for wonders greater in scale than any before them."

 tech_quasarcraft_3: "Galactic Halo"
 tech_quasarcraft_3_desc: "Our core already has great defence against enemy attacks, but we must also take into account our offense. To this effect, a great myriad of the strongest weaponry we can envision will be fitted onto a grand ring surrounding the core. A halo, if one wills."

 tech_quasarcraft_4: "Trillion Suns Wrath"
 tech_quasarcraft_4_desc: "The development of the weaponry for the Quasarcraft has been staggering, in terms of the raw power available. Our great minds have thus designed several truly gargantuan weapons that use the enhanced power of the Quasar, even retrofitting the old QSO weapons into something anew, and creating an incredibly powerful prototype component blueprint known only as... §RThe Endsinger.§!"

 tech_quasarcraft_5: "E.H.O.F Retrofitting"
 tech_quasarcraft_5_desc: "By tweaking and upscaling our existing $ehof_ehof_abr$ technologies, we can allow the Quasarcraft to create truly massive wormholes between systems, solving the issue of interstellar travel being otherwise impossible due to the sheer size of the structure eclipsing that of most hyperlanes"

 tech_quasarcraft_5_swap: "Quasarcraft Alternative FTL Travel Methods"
 tech_quasarcraft_5_swap_desc: "The Quasarcraft is simply too large to use typical hyperlanes; in order to prevent the largest instrument of war ever created from becoming a sitting duck, we must investigate alternative methods of FTL travel.\n\nFortunately, several alternative methods for us to explore, the most promising of which involves using the Hyperquasars cataclysmic energies to inflate artificial wormholes between star systems for the ship to utilize for interstellar travel."

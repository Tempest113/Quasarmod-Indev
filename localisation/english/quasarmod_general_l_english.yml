 # Teraforge

 tech_hyperquasaric_teraforge: "Hyperquasaric Megafoundries"
 tech_hyperquasaric_teraforge_desc: "Our ambitions are rapidly outgrowing our ability to produce the resources necessary to realize them, the cataclysmic power of an active hyperquasar may be able to help us with that."
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_TERAFORGE_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Hyperquasaric Teraforge"
 TECH_UNLOCK_HYPERQUASARIC_TERAFORGE_DESC: "A truly gargantuan alloy processing facility residing in the galactic core,\nreaching approximately 100 AU in diameter and harnessing the power of an active Hyperquasar, the Hyperquasaric Teraforge is the largest source of alloys in our corner of the universe."

 # Megashipyard

 tech_hyperquasaric_megashipyard: "Hyperquasaric Shipbuilding Facilities"

 # SMBH Manipulator

 tech_supermassive_blackhole_manipulator: "Supermassive Black Hole Manipulation"
 tech_supermassive_blackhole_manipulator_desc: "Perhaps one of the largest megastructures we will build for the next several hundred years: The Supermassive Black Hole Manipulator, a gargantuan terastructure which will allow us to bend the galactic core to our very will"
 TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulator"
 #TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Feature:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulation \n§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Supermassive Black Hole Manipulator"
 TECH_UNLOCK_BLACKHOLE_MANIPULATOR_DESC: "The supermassive black hole residing within the galactic core no longer suits our needs, we shall reshape it to better serve our empire."

 # Core MBrain

 tech_core_mbrain: "Hyperscale Black Hole Computation"
 tech_core_mbrain_desc: "Despite the fact that we have constructed the largest computational devices in history, our simulations and experiments are growing ever more complex and even the largest computers our galaxy has ever seen are struggling to keep up. We must go bigger."
 TECH_UNLOCK_GARGANTUAN_MBRAIN_TITLE: "§SUnlocks Megastructure:§! Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain"
 TECH_UNLOCK_GARGANTUAN_MBRAIN_DESC: "The most powerful computer to ever exist within the history of our galaxy, capable of mapping and accurately simulating hundreds of billions of star systems at once, we can effectively simulate an entire small universe with relative ease.\nThe existential and philosophical implications of such a fact will rock our society for generations to come."

 # Quasarcraft

 tech_quasarcraft_1: "An Armament of Galactic Proportions"
 tech_quasarcraft_1_desc: "With the advent of mightier foes, even such things like the Systemcraft are no longer strong enough. Our finest minds have thus began dreaming, and it is time to create a weapon to not only pierce the heavens, but to dominate the heavens. So begins the §MQuasarcraft Project.§!"
 allow_quasarcraft_p0: "Unlocks the foundation of the §MQuasarcraft§!"
 desc_quasarcraft_p0: "The Quasi-Stellar Obliterator can now be refitted to suit the construction of the Quasarcraft."

 tech_quasarcraft_2: "Quasaric Fortress Core"
 tech_quasarcraft_2_desc: "To lay the foundation upon which we will build the ultimate armament, we must first tear down the old. By refitting our §MQuasi-Stellar Obliterator§!, we can create not only a more defended facility, but an impenetrable fortress, a fully functional battlestation."
 allow_quasarcraft_p1: "Unlocks the First Stage of the §MQuasarcraft§!"
 desc_quasarcraft_p1: "Construction can commence on refitting the core of the QS-O."

 tech_quasarcraft_3: "Galactic Halo"
 tech_quasarcraft_3_desc: "Our core already has great defence against enemy attacks, but we must also take into account our offense. To this effect, a great myriad of the strongest weaponry we can envision will be fitted onto a grand ring surrounding the core. A halo, if one wills."
 allow_quasarcraft_p2: "Unlocks the Second Stage of the §MQuasarcraft§!"
 desc_quasarcraft_p2: "The Halo of the Quasarcraft can now be constructed."

 tech_quasarcraft_4: "Trillion Suns Wrath"
 tech_quasarcraft_4_desc: "The development of the weaponry for the §MQuasarcraft§! has been staggering, in terms of the raw power available. Our great minds have thus designed several truly gargantuan weapons that use the enhanced power of the Quasar, even retrofitting the old QSO weapons into something anew, and creating an incredibly powerful prototype component blueprint known only as... §RThe Endsinger.§!"
 allow_quasarcraft_p3: "Unlocks the Third Stage of the §MQuasarcraft§!"
 desc_quasarcraft_p3: "The Halo can now be fitted with its armaments."

 tech_quasarcraft_5: "Quasaric Event Horizon Offsetting"
 tech_quasarcraft_5_desc: "Now that all of the main armaments have been installed, the question arises, 'How are we supposed to be able to transport such mass across the galaxy?' The answer lies in the past - the §HEvent Horizen Offset Facility§!. Using advancements made in both fields, we will construct a gigastructural EHOF on the back of the §MQuasarcraft§!, which will expand wormholes to allow the mobile terastructure to 'jump' immense distances."
 allow_quasarcraft_p4: "Unlocks the Fourth Stage of the §MQuasarcraft§!"
 desc_quasarcraft_p4: "The Q-EHOF can now be installed onto the §MQuasarcraft§!"

 tech_quasarcraft_6: "§RThe Gargantuan Quasarcraft§!"
 tech_quasarcraft_6_desc: "The final designs and necessary facilities of the §MQuasarcraft§! are being finalized, and now the blueprint becomes available to us to design as we please. Engineers can barely contain their excitement, for the dream is almost fully realized."
 allow_quasarcraft_p5: "Unlocks the Final Stage of the §MQuasarcraft§!, and the ship itself in the Designer."
 desc_quasarcraft_p5: "§RDesign the Quasarcraft BEFORE finishing the final stage!§!"

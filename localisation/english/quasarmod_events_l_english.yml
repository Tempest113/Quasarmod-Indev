 quasarmod_megastage_dialogue.1.name: "Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain Construction"
 quasarmod_megastage_dialogue.1.desc: "We are now ready to begin the colossal task of constructing a Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain. The first step will be the construction of the hawking capacitors around the black hole, which will increase the rate at which hawking radiation is emitted. As each layer is added, more and more research will be generated. Keep in mind that the efficiency of the Gargantuan Matrioshka Brain will skyrocket once we finish the last layer. The planetary bodies of the system will be dismantled in order to make room for the terastructure."

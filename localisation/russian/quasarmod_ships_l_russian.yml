 # Quasarcraft Components/Actions
 QSC_DISRUPTOR: "Quasaric Sunsplitter"
 QSC_DISRUPTOR_DESC: "Similar to the Nicoll-Dyson Beam, the Sunsplitter focuses the diverted power of the Hyperquasar into a beam, which is then split into a myriad of rays by a star-sized prism."
 QSC_LASER_L: "Jupiter Annihilator"
 QSC_LASER_L_DESC: "These massive lances mounted on the Quasarcraft's Jupiter Arrays rain hell upon your foes, shattering the atoms of their very being."
 QSC_ENERGY_LANCE: "Quasaric Skyripper"
 QSC_ENERGY_LANCE_DESC: "The Skyripper cannons are designed to deter larger, stronger vessels such as a Systemcraft, focusing Quasaric Energy on a macro-scale, enough to shred stars by themselves."
 QSC_STRIKE_FORCE: "Celestial Strike Forces"
 QSC_STRIKE_FORCE_DESC: "No capital ship fights alone. The Celestial Strike Forces emerge from their grand hangars to deter any hope of infiltrating the king of the celestial warships. A myriad of automated $giga_planet_behemoth_plural$ freshly fabricated, armed and ready."
 QSC_TITANIC_GUN: "Quasi-Stellar Obliterator"
 QSC_TITANIC_GUN_DESC: "An immense weapon based on the old QSO weapon, but adapted for use as a ship weapon. A firearm of fear to strike terror into the collective conscious of the enemy."
 QSC_PLANET_LANCE: "Quasarcraft's Eye"
 QSC_PLANET_LANCE_DESC: "The power of this weapon almost escapes words, but our engineers came up with an apt phrase: 'The Fury of a Trillion Suns'. This weapon draws upon massive portions of the Quasarcraft's full power to utterly obliterate the target."
 QSC_ENDSINGER: "§MThe Endsinger§!"
 QSC_ENDSINGER_DESC: "The only thing they know will be despair as this utterly powerful re-tooling of the original QSO's destructive power comes in a package anew. §MThe Endsinger§! allows the Quasarcraft to have fine control over the amount of destruction it unleashes."

 QSC_REACTOR: "Enslaved Hyperquasar"
 QSC_REACTOR_DESC: "The heart of the Galaxy beats within the gentle cage of the Quasarcraft, providing immense amounts of energy."
 QSC_THRUSTER: "Spacio-Gravitic Manuevering Array"
 QSC_THRUSTER_DESC: "An utterly gargantuan set of maneuvering devices capable of translating the mighty craft through systems with great haste."
 QSC_DRIVE: "Quasaric Event Horizon Projector"
 QSC_DRIVE_DESC: "Instead of warping the entire 2 lightyears worth of warship through hyperspace, our engineers took inspiration from the EHOF, creating a massive wormhole projector that stretches a wormhole behind the Quasarcraft, which the gargantuan starship then backs into."
 QSC_SENSOR: "Spacio-Temporal Stringreader"
 QSC_SENSOR_DESC: "While not actually measuring cosmic string vibrations, the Stringreader still does amazing work through intense hyperspacial-reference mapping, precise enough to pinpoint a single person on a planet."
 QSC_COMPUTER: "Harbinger Starship Intelligence"
 QSC_COMPUTER_DESC: "The Harbinger System coordinates and synchronizes actions and commands from across the gargantuan machine, allowing for deadly efficiency in dispatching hostile forces."
 QUASARCRAFT_BEHAVIOR_DESC: "The Quasarcraft will stay at the edge of the system and target anything hostile in the star system."

 QSC_AURA_GRAVSNARE: "Gravitic Flux Field"
 QSC_AURA_GRAVSNARE_DESC: "Utilizing the immense gravity around the Hyperquasar, we can project and manipulate a field of spacetime around the quasarcraft, desynchronising hostile chronology and also trapping them to assure their untimely demise."
 QSC_AURA_EYE: "Eye of Hawking"
 QSC_AURA_EYE_DESC: "With the great precision of our Quasarcraft's Stringreader, we can further utilize the data by relaying them to our additional forces, allowing them to have greatly increased efficiency in firepower."
 QSC_AURA_GRAVSPEED: "Slipstream Field"
 QSC_AURA_GRAVSPEED_DESC: "The Slipstream Field smoothens the journeys of friendly interlopers, giving them incredible speed across the system and streamlining hyperspace travel."
 QSC_AURA_DEATHFIELD: "Quasaric Presence"
 QSC_AURA_DEATHFIELD_DESC: "The aspects of the Quasarcraft's immense size can quite simply be used to crush less resilient vessels with emitted ambient energy and manipulated gravity."

 FLEETORDER_DESTROY_PLANET_WITH_QSC_ENDSINGER: "Firing Endsinger at $PLANET|Y$"
 MESSAGE_DESC_FOR_QSC_ENDSINGER: "$PLANET|Y$ was erased by"
 QSC_ENDSINGER_ACTION: "Fire Endsinger"

 aura_ship_quasar_snare: "Gravitic Snare"

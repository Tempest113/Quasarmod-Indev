3.13 To Do:

~~Improve/Fix opinion modifiers for destroying/damaging planets in QSC destruction event (turns out people hate their planets being erased from existence, who would have thought?)~~ Later, this shit's annoying

~~Look into excluding maginot protected systems (subspace shielding) Conflicts with being able to destroy Aeternum with the endsinger (sad times)~~

~~Consider adding core flags to destroyed QSC quasar~~

~~Allow direct targeting of Aeternite birch (also have to add unique mechanics to planet/system targeting mode to fire the end of aeternum event)~~ ~~(Look into preventing the double "end of aeternum event". not that it causes issues)~~

~~Add galactic notif event for QSC self-destruction taking out Aiondia~~ Maybe add specific event for QSC self-destruction

~~Add icons to the mega build menu~~

Add all of this to the changelog

~~Write flavour event for QSC self-destruction, similar to the QSC defeated event~~

~~Prevent QSC self destruction from nuking aeternum~~

~~Add QSC self destruction desc to qsc_endsinger.1.desc~~

~~Stop the QSC from destroying the birch (the shield protects it or something :shrug: )~~

~~Remove unnecessary "turn star into brown dwarf" code from qsc_endsinger.100~~ 

~~Prevent using the planetary destruction mode on stars, turning the sun into a molten world breaks things (or have it change the star to a brown dwarf with an if = {} block, which would be easier than adding extra restrictions)~~

~~Prevent QSC explosion from destroying core systems (like if you destroy it directly next to the core)~~

~~Look into making Jupitwo brown dwarf immune to QSC death (magic or something idk), having it delete the brown dwarf/star breaks things~~

~~Delete temp effect file when 100% it is not needed~~

~~Do quasarmod_qsc_destroyed_nearby loc~~

~~Redo QSC destroyed event loc again (mention the nearby damage)~~

~~Add QSC self-destruction option~~

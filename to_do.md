To Do:

Improve/Fix opinion modifiers for destroying/damaging planets in QSC destruction event (turns out people hate their planets being erased from existence, who would have thought?)

Add QSC self destruction option

Look into making Jupitwo brown dwarf immune to QSC death (magic or something idk), having it delete the brown dwarf/star breaks things

Delete temp effect file when 100% it is not needed

Do qsc_destroyed_nearby loc

Redo QSC destroyed event loc again (mention the nearby damage)

Consider adding core flags to destroyed QSC quasar

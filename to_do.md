To Do:

Improve/Fix opinion modifiers for destroying/damaging planets in QSC destruction event (turns out people hate their planets being erased from existence, who would have thought?)

~~Write flavour event for QSC self-destruction, similar to the QSC defeated event~~ - Consider rewriting/expanding on this event

~~Add QSC self destruction desc to qsc_endsinger.1.desc~~

Stop the QSC from destroying the birch (the shield protects it or something :shrug: )

Remove unnecessary "turn star into brown dwarf" code from qsc_endsinger.100 

~~Prevent using the planetary destruction mode on stars, turning the sun into a molten world breaks things (or have it change the star to a brown dwarf with an if = {} block, which would be easier than adding extra restrictions)~~

Consider adding core flags to destroyed QSC quasar

~~Prevent QSC explosion from destroying core systems (like if you destroy it directly next to the core)~~ also look into excluding the aeternite core/maginot protected systems (subspace shielding)

Add all of this to the changelog

~~Look into making Jupitwo brown dwarf immune to QSC death (magic or something idk), having it delete the brown dwarf/star breaks things~~

~~Delete temp effect file when 100% it is not needed~~

~~Do quasarmod_qsc_destroyed_nearby loc~~

~~Redo QSC destroyed event loc again (mention the nearby damage)~~

~~Add QSC self-destruction option~~
